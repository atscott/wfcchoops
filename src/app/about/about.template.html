    <h2><br>WFCC: <em>WHAT</em> we are and <em>WHO</em> we are?</h2>
    <p>The Wrightstown Full-Court Club (WFCC) is a youth basketball club which was formed in September, 2006. It
      was established to provide boys and girls from Kindergarten through eighth grade, who reside in the
      boundaries of the Wrightstown, Wisconsin school district and plan on attending Wrightstown High School,
      an opportunity to compete at the highest level of youth basketball. WFCC has made many contributions to
      the Wrightstown Basketball Program, including the purchase of "The Gun" and the donation of a new
      scoreboard in the northwest corner of the high school gym. For more on our contributions and
      accomplishments, view our "brag sheet" by <a href="assets/docs/WFCC Brag Sheet 2016.pdf">clicking
