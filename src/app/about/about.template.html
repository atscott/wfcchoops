      <h2><br>WFCC: <em>WHAT</em> we are and <em>WHO</em> we are?</h2>
      <p>The Wrightstown Full-Court Club (WFCC) is a youth basketball club which was formed in September, 2006. It was established to provide boys and girls from Kindergarten through eighth grade, who reside in the boundaries of the Wrightstown, Wisconsin school district and plan on attending Wrightstown High School, an opportunity to compete at the highest level of youth basketball. WFCC has made many contributions to the Wrightstown Basketball Program, including the purchase of "The Gun" and the donation of a new scoreboard in the northwest corner of the high school gym.  For more on our contributions and accomplishments, view our "brag sheet" by <a href="/files/docs/WFCC Brag Sheet 2010.pdf">clicking here</a>.</p>
      <h2>Our Goals:</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>To provide coaching of the highest quality to enhance player development.</li>
        <li>To be an example of class, conducting ourselves in an honorable and&nbsp;sportsmanlike manner.</li>
        <li>To further enhance and provide our boys and girls the opportunity to compete&nbsp;and play at the highest level of youth basketball in the immediate area.&nbsp;</li>
