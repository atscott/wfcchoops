<p>Dear Wrightstown Full-Court Club players and parents:</p>

<p>Congratulations to all of our WFCC teams and players that played
this season! All six of our teams were very successful. I want to
personally thank all the coaches and parents for all of their time
associated with our teams. Great work by all!</p>

<p>With the WFCC seasons concluding, the basketball season does not
end now though. There are even more opportunities for your child to
play and improve their overall basketball skills this off-season. I
really hope that all our WFCC players take advantage of our
District's summer school program and Tiger Camp. Please check out
and utilize our WFCC website at www.wfcchoops.com for updated
information regarding our Club and other basketball related
opportunities.</p>

<h4>SUMMER SCHOOL</h4>

<p>I am teaching the 3rd/4th grade, 5th/6th grade, and 7th/8th grade
boys' basketball summer school courses our District offers. I
sincerely hope to see your son sign up for these courses. These
courses are high energy and are a perfect blend of fundamental
development and game strategies. Dates of summer school are <font
color="red"><bold>June 9 to June 27.</bold></font></p>

<h4>TIGER CAMP</h4>

<p>Tiger Camp will be held after the above mentioned summer school
program. Tiger Camp dates are:
<ul>
<li><font color="red"><bold>June 9 through June 12</bold></font> for girls.</li>
<li><font color="red"><bold>July 7 through July 10</bold></font> for boys.</li>
</ul>
Brochures and registration forms are ready for download now:
<ul>

</ul>
</p>

<h4>15,000 SHOT CLUB</h4>
<p>Congrats to Andrew Scott, Kurt Jansen, Brandon Do-McKenzie, Michael
Falck, Jordan Johnson, Cody Lukes, Craig Nennig, Bryce Buboltz, and
Nathan Larson! These players filled out the proper paperwork to prove
that they completed the 15,000 Shot Club requirements from last
off-season. By doing so, their names will be added to the plaque in
the HS trophy case, receive a t-shirt, and an individual award. Your
son will receive more information on this shot club in summer school
courses for this current off-season. It is an excellent way to track
your off-season shooting and earn an extra reward for an awesome
effort!</p>

<h4>OPEN GYMS AT HIGH SCHOOL</h4>
<p>Our High School staff will be supervising open gyms throughout the
spring and summer. All open gyms will be from <font color="red"><bold>6:00-8:00 p.m. on
Monday and Wednesday nights.</bold></font> Dates are:
